# Join us

Would you want to be a part of an open-source community that publishes about
what's going on open source projects, Linux, BSD or UNIX with guides, news and
newsletters?

If it is your wish, here is our deal: that'll be so easy, but first of we want
to introduce ourselves.

## About Linux Kafası

Linux Kafası was founded by @BerkhanBerkdemir in Fall 2015 in [Istanbul][i],
Turkey. The main goal was to share Linux knowledge with simple guides or
videos, and now, we do:

* Guides
* News
* Newsletters

about Linux, BSD or all most anything about *free* open-source projects.

## Open positions

We do have some open positions now :tada:, and they have specialties; however,
all of positions requires these [requirements](requirements.md).

* [Editor](positions/editor.md)
